# Vue Router

## Why

We want our application to be a SPA (Single Page App), this means that it doesn't go back to the web server to retrieve each page.  

## First Example 01 is using HTML

This is not a single-page app, but rather an example where each page is loaded from the server.

## Second Example spa-lesson23

First commit is what you get from using the vue command to create a new project with vue-router.
